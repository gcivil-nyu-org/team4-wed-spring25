Hi {{ user.get_username }},

You (or someone pretending to be you) asked to change the password for your {{ site_name }} account.

To set a new password, click the link below:

{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_change_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If you didn’t request this, you can safely ignore this message—no changes will be made.

Thanks,
The {{ site_name }} Team
